What this program needs to do:
 ☐ Read appropriate matrix element tensor files
 ☐ Convert them into literal matrices to be operated on
 ☐ Applies the different math functions on each necessary element
 ☐ Returns formatted files that can be ploted

 It would be nice:
 ☐ Include all the rotation stuff into the script, even though that's done at a different stage in the calculation
 ☐ Automatically create gnuplot scripts, or
 ☐ Actually connect with gnuplot and plot automagically
