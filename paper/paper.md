# Summary

SHGYield is a python program for calculating the second-harmonic generation (SHG) yield for semiconductor surfaces. This is useful for conducting theoretical second-harmonic spectroscopy of any crystalline semiconductor or nanostructure. The physical theory behind this phenomenon is presented in the references below. We have applied this software to several silicon test cases and have achieved very accurate results that compare well with experiment.
