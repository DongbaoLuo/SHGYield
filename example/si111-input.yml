# Sample input file for calculating SHG yield for the Si(111)(1x1):H surface
# This is in YAML, so please preserve indentation below!

# Establish reflectance model, see PRB 93, 235304 (2016). Available choices:
# 3-layer or 2-layer. Only '3-layer' will include multiple reflections.
mode:       3-layer

# Establish the 1w energy range or value over which you wish to calculate the
# yield. Can be either a list ([start, stop, step], note square brackets), or a
# single integer or float value. NOTE: the desired range or value must be within
# the calculated range of your chi1 (for 1w and 2w!) and chi2 (only 1w) files,
# otherwise the splines will attempt to extrapolate and fail. Some examples:
# energy:     [0.00, 10.0, 1001]  # from 0 to 10 eV, in 1001 steps (0.01 eV)
energy_spectra: [1.25, 2.5, 126]    # from 1.25 to 2.5 eV, in 126 steps (0.01 eV)
energy_polar:   1.7

# Required calculation parameters
parameters:
    gamma: 90           # rotation for CHI2 in degrees; 90 is equal to no rotation.
    theta: 65           # angle of incidence in degrees
    phi:   30           # azimuthal angle, or range of angles in degrees
    sigma: 5            # the sigma parameter of the gaussian function in samples;
                        # for data sampled every 0.01 eV, a value of 5 means that 
                        # sigma = 0.05 eV.

# Multiple reflection framework
multiref:
    enable:    yes      # if multiple reflections are taken into account. Can
                        # be 'yes' or 'no'; if 'no', next values are ignored.
    thickness: 10       # thickness "d" of the thin layer, in nm
    depth:     average  # depth "d2" of the nonlinear polarization, in nm. can
                        # be a float or 'average'. See Eqs (21) and 22 of 
                        # PRB 93, 235304 (2016).

# chi2: nonlinear susceptibility tensor 
# Components should be in separate files, and listed separately. Symmetry 
# relations can be represented here. There are 4 options for each component:
#
# 1. ZERO if it is not listed or commented out (i.e. '# xxx: ...')
# 2. ZERO if you give it a value of 0, i.e     (i.e. 'xxx: 0')         
# 3. Loaded from file if path is given         (i.e. 'xxx: ../SiH1x1-chi2-xxx')
# 4. Has some relation to another component    (i.e. 'xyy: -xxx')
#
# File columns should be organized as Energy(1w) Re[1w] Im[1w] Re[2w] Im[2w].
