# To-do for SHGYield.py

## Main Program




## GUI

The GUI should be divided into three distinct elements (tabs?):
1. Loading the necessary material information. The user should first decide
   between either the 2-layer or 3-layer models, as these describe most cases.
   Other models will be deprecated. Once the model is established, the user must
   define the pertinent physical quantities, i.e. index of refraction, epsilon,
   or susceptibility tensors. The user should be able to load several cases,
   that will be subsequently processed and plotted.
2. Displaying the relevant susceptibility tensors, epsilon, etc. The user should
   have the option to change the symmetries, disregard tensor components, and
   averaging over various components. The user will be able to vary the rotation
   angle that will rotate the entire tensor, and will also be able to change the
   broadening and see the effect on the tensor components. Selection of which
   components, parts (real and imaginary), and cases should all be possible via
   the interface.
3. 


## I/O Options

CONSIDER PRE-PROCESSING INTO NETCDF FILES

1. The program should be able to output NetCDF files with all the necessary data. These files could be parsed in order to extract the susceptibility components, calculation data, etc. or can be loaded again with the program which could potentially save time.
