Testing
======================================

Python requirements:
`pytest`, `numpy`

Usage:
Simply run `pytest` in the root directory. It will automatically detect and run the appropriate tests contained in `self_test.py`. That script tests the different functions and calculations that are run in the main program. It will also compare the final result against a reference dataset in order to compare numerical accuracy.
