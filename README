nrc.py
===========================

nrc.py is a python program designed to calculate the Nonlinear reflection
coefficient for silicon surfaces. It works in conjunction with the matrix
elements calculated using ABINIT, and open source ab initio software,
and TINIBA, our in-house optical calculation software.

The work codified in this software can be found in Phys.Rev.B66,195329(2002).
