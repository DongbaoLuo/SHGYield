	abstract = {Optical second-harmonic generation (SHG) from silicon surfaces may be resonantly enhanced by dangling-bond-derived surface states. The resulting high sensitivity to hydrogen adsorption combined with unique features of SHG as an optical probe has been exploited to study various kinetical and dynamical aspects of the adsorption system H2/Si. Studies of surface diffusion of H/Si(111)7×7 and recombinative desorption of hydrogen from Si(111)7 × 7 and Si(100)2 × 1 revealed that the covalent nature of hydrogen bonding on silicon surfaces leads to high diffusion barriers and to desorption kinetics that strongly depend on the surface structure. Recently, dissociative adsorption of molecular hydrogen on Si(100)2×1 and Si(111)7×7 could be observed for the first time by heating the surfaces to temperatures between 550 K and 1050 K and monitoring the SH response during exposure to a high flux of H2 or D2. The measured initial sticking coefficients for a gas temperature of 300K range from 10−9 to 10−5 and strongly increase as a function of surface temperature. These results demonstrate that the lattice degrees of freedom may play a decisive role in the reaction dynamics on semiconductor surfaces.},

	abstract = {We formulate a theoretical approach of surface second-harmonic generation from semiconductor surfaces based on the length gauge and the electron density operator. Within the independent particle approximation, the nonlinear second-order surface susceptibility tensor χabc(−2ω;ω,ω) is calculated, including in one unique formulation (i) the scissors correction, needed to have the correct value of the energy band gap, (ii) the contribution of the nonlocal part of the pseudopotentials, routinely used in ab initio band-structure calculations, and (iii) the derivation for the inclusion of the cut function, used to extract the surface response. The first two contributions are described by spatially nonlocal quantum-mechanical operators and are fully taken into account in the present formulation. As a test case of the approach, we calculate χxxx(−2ω;ω,ω) for the clean Si(001)2×1 reconstructed surface. The effects of the scissors correction and of the nonlocal part of the pseudopotentials are discussed in surface nonlinear optics. The scissors correction shifts the spectrum to higher energies though the shifting is not rigid and mixes the 1ω and 2ω resonances, and has a strong influence in the line shape. The effects of the nonlocal part of the pseudopotentials keeps the same line shape of ∣∣χxxx2×1(−2ω;ω,ω)∣∣, but reduces its value by 15\%–20\%. Therefore the inclusion of the three aforementioned contributions is very important and makes our scheme unprecedented and opens the possibility to study surface second-harmonic generation with more versatility and providing more accurate results.},

	abstract = {The performance of many devices based on Si thin films deposited on crystalline Si (c−Si) is highly governed by interface quality. For many of these applications, only fully epitaxial films or fully amorphous films having an abrupt interface with the substrate are desired. However, the realization of these perfectly sharp interfaces and the mechanisms governing their formation are not fully understood yet. In this study, the interface formation between Si thin films and c−Si has been investigated by simultaneously applying three complementary optical techniques in real time during low temperature Si film growth. The films were deposited in a hot-wire chemical vapor deposition process by using both native oxide covered and H terminated Si(100) substrates. The formation of hydrogenated amorphous Si (a−Si:H), epitaxial Si, and mixed phase Si has been detected with spectroscopic ellipsometry by measuring the optical properties of the growing films. The evolution of the hydrogen content and hydrogen bonding configurations in the films has been monitored by attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy. A clear dependence of the hydrogen content on film morphology is observed with the amorphous films containing significantly more hydrogen. The surface and interface sensitive technique of second-harmonic generation (SHG) has been applied both spectroscopically and in real time. The SHG spectra of a−Si:H films on Si(100) obtained in the SHG photon energy range of 2.7–3.5eV revealed a dominant contribution originating from the film/substrate interface related to E′0/E1 critical point (CP) transitions of c−Si. The real-time behavior of the SHG response is shown to strongly depend on differences in initial film morphology, which allows for identification of direct a−Si:H/c−Si heterointerface formation, nanometer-level epitaxial growth, and fully epitaxial growth at a very early stage of film growth. On the basis of the results obtained by the three optical techniques, the c−Si surface passivation mechanism by a−Si:H thin films is addressed and it is demonstrated that the combination of the techniques provides a profound method to control processes occurring during Si thin film growth.},
