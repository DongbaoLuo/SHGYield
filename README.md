===========================
This repo houses the source code for my research project on the nonlinear
reflection coefficient for silicon surfaces.

![](https://raw2.github.com/roguephysicist/nrc/master/article/figure.png)

The major work are python scripts that calculate the nonlinear reflection
coeffecient from data calculated with TINIBA and the ABINIT code. TINIBA is
our in-house optical calculation software and can be found in an adjacent
repository.

Also included are a variety of plots with necessary source files. All plots
can be compiled with Gnuplot and LaTeX.
